# Acceptance Testing Template for C# and dotnet core

This template collects some common resources that we use on nearly every project for acceptance testing; creating a project of this type will give you:

* A new "AcceptanceTests" project containing SpecFlow
* Scaffolding code to spin up and shut down a local Azure Functions host
* Scaffolding code to spin up and shut down fake endpoints using WireMock.Net
